    <h1 class="intro">ProfessionaL Background</h1>
    <p class="professional">My name is Brian Kipkoech, a dedicated and detail-oriented IT professional with a Bachelor's degree in Information
    Technology, graduating with Second Class Honours (Lower Division). During my academic journey and industrial attachment,
    I gained practical experience in network support, data entry, and computer maintenance, including software installation
    and updates. This hands-on exposure enhanced my understanding of IT infrastructure and strengthened my ability to
    troubleshoot and maintain efficient digital systems. <br>
    
    I have specialized in both programming and networking, allowing me to approach technical challenges from multiple
    angles. Currently, I am actively expanding my expertise in software development, focusing on advanced HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript, and React. I am passionate about creating responsive, user-friendly web applications and continuously strive
    to stay up to date with emerging technologies. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry by delivering
    smart, scalable solutions and growing as a well-rounded developer.
